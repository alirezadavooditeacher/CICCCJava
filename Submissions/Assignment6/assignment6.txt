Create a Java project with the sample code we did in the lecture in the last session (About Delegation). 
Then make the following changes:

1.	Create a new service provider called, "CarRepairServiceProvider" which does a car repair service.
	The car repair service contains 
		a) description
		b) car model 
		Add all required classes to let the client request for a car repair service. 
	Create a test scenario in the "ApplicationDriver" class and 
	also write at-least one unit test for it in a test class.

2.	Create a new service provider called, "HomeServiceProvider" which performs three 
	types of home services 
		1) CookingService 
		2) WashingService 
		3) BabySittingService. 
		Add 2 arbitrary properties for each source and then add other required classes.

3.	Create a new service provider called, "StudentServicesProvider" which provide one student service. 
	Add two arbitrary properties for the StudentService. In addition to the StudentService, 
	the provider also provide an optional service which is informing the client know 
	when the requested service is completed.

For all 3 items above, write some test scenarios in the "ApplicationDriver" class and 
also add unit tests. Also please do not add any extra properties in the "Client" class. 
The only new properties (instance variables) you need to add to the Client class 
are the references to the providers (similar to the CleaningService and PaintingService 
references already available in the class Client).
