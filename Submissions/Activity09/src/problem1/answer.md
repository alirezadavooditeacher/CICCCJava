## Add the following class Test64 to your project and run it. What is the output?
```
Error:(14, 13) java: constructor Object in class java.lang.Object cannot be applied to given types;
required: no arguments
found: int
reason: actual and formal argument lists differ in length
```

## Remove the Test64 class from your Project and add it as an inner class to the Foo1 class. Fix the bugs if you get any. Run it again. What would be the output?
```
I don't understand what you want me to do in Constructor in Foo2.
