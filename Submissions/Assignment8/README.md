## Problem 1

The implementation is on [src/app/SearchBook.java](src/app/SearchBook.java).

> 8\. What is the time and space complexity of the app method? Explain why?

It's `O(n)` because I use liner app since we need to iterate all over the pages to check if they have images and to get the number of pages.

## Problem 2

The implementation is on [src/app/SearchBook.java](src/app/SearchBook.java).
